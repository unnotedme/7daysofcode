# #7daysofcode

seven challenges. in the technology you are learning. practice, study and showcase your portfolio. challenges created by alura.

your project will be as follows: a medical clinic hired you to develop a responsive page so that your doctors and doctors hired can have control over all their scheduled appointments, whether in person or remotely.

for that, they sent you a layout in figma. and from that prototype, you'll turn it into code and give the project real life!
